Texture maps use a (u,v) co ordinate system as opposed to the (x.y) used fot layouts. This is only used as a method
to distinguish the two. Now each model of x,y will have a mapping to u,v and this is th uv mapping used to map texture
to models.

VAO will now store 2 VBOs layout co ordinates and now texture co ordinates.

Uniform variables are variables in the Shader code that can be set using Java code.

Entity is used to represent an instance of a textured model along with all the transformations applied to it.

Integrating a projection matrix so as to allow for a more realistic feel and what not. There are essentially three
properties that come into play when using this method, the field of view angle, near plane distance and far plane
distance. The exact same projection matrix we have used in class is being used here again, this corresponds to


Just like a projection matrix exists for simulating the z-axis and 3D to 2D conversions, a similar matrix known as the
view matrix is used to simulate camera movements.

Normal vectors are used to carry out calculations for lighting directions. The angular difference between the normal at
any point on an object and the vector pointing to the light sources determines the intensity of lighting.  This can also
be done using the dot product of two vectors.
